It is now feasible to pinpoint position coordinates precisely thanks to advancements made by the Global Positioning System and other navigation satellite systems. High-speed internet connectivity and the emergence of smart devices have both aided in the development programmes that use location data. Geofencing is a significant location-based services sector that allows for remote monitoring of predetermined limits. The paper has outlined a number of applications of geofencing and offers a fresh perspective on kid protection
app that makes use of geofencing. A hardware configuration is made to real-time transmission of a child's position coordinates.
An app is created to help parents keep an eye on their kids distantly. In the app, they can create a geofence and get notifications.
when the kid crosses the line.
